This program is designed to aquire continuous data samples from an NI_9215A DAQ, and plot a continuously updated histogram of said samples.

Due to proprietry (and ancient) NI kernel modules it is strongly reccommended to use the following system:

SL5.5
kernel 2.6.18-194.32.1.el5

The program is based around:

Qt 4.5.1
fontconfig-2.4.2 
qwt-5.1.2
nidaqmxbase-3.4.0

Deviating from this configuration is likely to lead to dependancy hell.
